Exercise:
The goal of this activity is to define Moore's law and describe the physical limitations in devices that have stopped it from continuing to be true.

Moore's Law:
It states that transistors density is doubling every two years. Which in turn means that speeds are doubling as smaller transistors switch faster.
However, this is not true anymore. It was just an observation at that time, it is not a physical law.

Reasons why Moore's Law does not hold anymore:
- Power wall: (P = alfa*C*F*V*V). If you double the density, transistors switch faster (clock rate increases) - with that power consumption increases too (freq is F in formula above).
- Temperature: increased power consumption means increased temperature/heat. You need very efficient cooling, air cooling is effective only to a point. 
- Dennard Scaling: power consumption can be lowered by lowering voltage swing (V in a formula), but you cannot go below a certain threshold.
- Noise problem: if you go too low with decreasing voltage swing values - there will be noise interference from the environment.
- Leakage power: if density increases, so does the leakage power. It is not taken into accound by Dennard Scaling.

All, those physical limitations impact Moore's law.
